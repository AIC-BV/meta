# Build 1.1.8 (WIP)

## UX/UI Improvements
-

## API Changes
- Classes implementing the `System\Traits\PropertyContainer` trait to provide dynamic property options for Inspector fields no longer need to have zero (or one optional) parameters in their constructor in order to work correctly. Note that if your constructor requires a value in any property and does not define a default, this will still fail, so ideally you should use a class specifically set up for handling Inspector properties.
