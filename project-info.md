The OctoberCMS project consists of three different GitHub Organizations and the OctoberCMS.com website.

## GitHub Organizations

1. [OctoberCMS](https://github.com/octobercms): This is the main organization and the intent is to keep it clean and simple for any newcomers to the project.
2. [OctoberRain](https://github.com/octoberrain): This is the secondary organization and is used for things that are involved in the project but aren't necessary for newcomers to know about / see when viewing the octobercms repositories. I.e. October.Drivers, Acme.Test (test plugin), subsplit repositories for Composer support, the Meta repository, etc.
3. [RainLab](https://github.com/rainlab): This is the organization for plugins & themes released by the core development team behind OctoberCMS. When functionality is added that is better suited as a plugin but is still common enough for a significant number of users to find value in it (and is being developed & maintained by the core team), this organization is where those themes & plugins should go.

## OctoberCMS.com - The Marketplace

The Marketplace serves 4 primary functions:

1. Introduce new users to OctoberCMS and convince them to start using it
2. Source of income for the project through the plugin & theme Marketplace gratuities fee, Partners section, & Fundraising section
3. Public facing documentation for the project at https://octobercms.com/docs
4. Delivers core, plugin, & theme updates to OctoberCMS instances

The marketplace is maintained and improved on by [@alekseybobkov](https://github.com/alekseybobkov) and [@daftspunk](https://github.com/daftspunk).
