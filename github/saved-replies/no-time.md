The support demand for October is increasing, while the available time the founders have to give remains the same. These issues will be handled in time, however there are ways you can help:

- Submit a pull request that introduces this feature and wait for it to be reviewed
- [Contribute to my Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/LukeTowers) so that I can spend more time on issues like these
- [Make a financial contribution to the project](https://octobercms.com/fundraising) so we can allocate more time towards making improvements like these that benefit everyone
